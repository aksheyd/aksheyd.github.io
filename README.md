# Personal Portfolio (Github Pages)
Hello! Welcome to the repo for my personal portfolio!


I've been using this as a project to showcase my "resume" digitally while also learning fullstack web development.


This branch features my deployment in [my Github Pages site](https://aksheyd.github.io/). I've been using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to build this site. I've also been using GSAP for some animations and transitions as well as tsParticles for the background particles.

# Fun Facts:
- From scratch, I finished a REST API framework on a flight back to school ✈️
  - I had a working API 30,000 ft in the air, **what an incredible time to be alive**
  - sidenote: I never got to use the API in this site, but it will make an appearance in the future
- I started this project with like 0 JavaScript knowledge (I used to just get by using chatgpt)
  - My first 8 hours of coding was 3 boxes and an image of myself that wouldn't render
